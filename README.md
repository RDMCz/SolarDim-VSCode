# Better Solarized [![release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/edheltzel/vscode-better-solarized.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white&colorA=101119&colorB=073642)](https://github.com/edheltzel/flightdeck/releases/latest)

This originally was a modified version of the
[Boxy Solarized Theme](https://github.com/ihodev/sublime-boxy), with the
original Solarized Workbench theme for Visual Studio Code. It has since shifted
to being it's own theme with a few tweaks and customizations, drawing
inspiration from the original
[Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) project and now includes
the
[Selenized](https://github.com/jan-warchol/selenized/blob/master/whats-wrong-with-solarized.md)
color palette.

Five(5) variants:

1. Solarized Dark
2. Solarized Light
3. Solarized Dark with Italics
4. Selenized Dark
5. Selenized Light
