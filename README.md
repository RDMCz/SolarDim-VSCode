# Better Solarized [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/ginfuru/vscode-better-solarized.svg)](https://github.com/ginfuru/vscode-better-solarized/releases)

This originally was a modified version of the
[Boxy Solarized Theme](https://github.com/ihodev/sublime-boxy), with the
original Solarized Workbench theme for Visual Studio Code. It has since shifted
to being it's own theme with a few tweaks and customizations, drawing
inspiration from the original
[Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) project and now includes
the
[Selenized](https://github.com/jan-warchol/selenized/blob/master/whats-wrong-with-solarized.md)
color palette.

Five(5) variants:

1. Solarized Light
2. Solarized Dark
3. Solarized Dark with Italics
4. Selenized Dark
5. Selenized Dark with Italics
